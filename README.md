**<h2>DataBase Query</h2>**

###

Database in practice with simple and easy-to-understand `scripts`. `SQL` or `MySQL` databases are basically data creations, tables, information, diagrams, etc...
When creating, we can edit, add, or delete data from a table. It is not complex at all and is also part of the `Back-End`!
